## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dotted underline for AI notes: Visual distinction between user highlights and AI-annotated highlights without changing color (Pending)
- Draggable popups (unconstrained): User wants to move popups anywhere on screen to see paper context (Pending)
- Preserve highlight color on AI ask: Current behavior overwrites color to yellow, losing user's organizational system (Pending)
- [Phase 01-01]: Retired 'note' as a color value - highlights preserve original user-selected colors when notes are added
- [Phase 01-01]: Use borderBottom instead of textDecoration for dotted underline (overlay divs require border-based styling)
- [Phase 01-01]: All highlights can open notes panel regardless of color (removed isNote-based restrictions)
- [Phase 01-03]: 25% zoom step increments for usability (not 10% or 50%)
- [Phase 01-03]: Percentage display doubles as reset button to page-width
